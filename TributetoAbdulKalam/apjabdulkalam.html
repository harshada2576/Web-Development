          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <emphasis>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </emphasis>(15 October
            1931 -27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman
            who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and
            raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied
            physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as
            a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
            Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
            Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
            civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
            He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He
            also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role
            in Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after
            the first test in 1974.
